			<p id="paragraph">I was born a synaesthete. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/science/hearingcolours.shtml" target="_blank">Synaesthesia</a> is a neurological condition in which two or more of the five senses are experienced involuntarily at once.</p>
			<p id="paragraph">In my case, I experience sight-touch, sound-touch, grapheme-colur, taste-sight, sound-sight and conceptual synaeshtesia. Most of the time this represents more challenges than advantages as a Mathematics student since there is no practical use to feeling sounds and colours, seeing music or tasting mathematical operations.</p>
			<p id="paragraph">Having an appreciation for the arts and the senses has left me feeling like something is missing in my day-to-day life as a Mathematics student. I have decided to give myself the opportunity to explore settings where music, painting, writing and dancing are practiced with no judgement of what is right or wrong about expressing one's Self.</p>
			<p id="paragraph">One example is the <a href="http://schoolofsense.com/" target="_blank">Sense Workshop Series</a>. Here I have been able to fuse my love for creative expression as well as my logical skills. For the past three months I have been the Drop-In Admin and so I ensure maximum capacities per workshop are not exceeded. I also analyze data from students once the workshop is completed.</p>
			<p id="paragraph">Another example of this is the work I have been doing as an organizer for the music festival taking place this Summer: <a href="http://resurgence.intentiongathering.org/info" target="_blank">Resurgence</a>. I am currently in charge of coordinating workshops as well as recruiting and leading volunteers for the First Aid Pod.</p>
