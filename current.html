			<p id="paragraph">I am currently taking online courses on HTML, HTML5, CSS, CSS3, JavaScript,PHP and MySQL as my goal is to build an interactive website for synaesthetes to connect and share their gifts.</p>
			<p id="paragraph">As synaesthetes, it is common for us to be laughed at or not validated in our experiences. I personally think that celebrating our quirks is what allows us to create beautiful things and I want to contribute in this by providing a space for people to share what makes them unique.</p>
			<p id="paragraph">Through this website I will also post relevant information on Workshops whose theme is synaesthesia and the expression of one's Self through music, dancing and painting.</p>

			<p id="syn">Workshop Facilitation</p>
			<p id="paragraph">My goal is to first learn from those who have facilitated workshops on a wide range of topics and also learn the administration details that usually occur behind the scenes. My strategy was to attend workshops on a variety of formats before facilitating. Through the implementation of this strategy I learned the crucial role that self growth plays in workshop facilitation.</p>
			<p id="sub">Self growth</p>
			<p id="paragraph">Since January 2016, I have attended numerous workshops through <a href="https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/sense-workshops-vancouver-spring-session-tickets-22928471676">Sense</a> - a workshop series led by Loretta Laurin, on several occasions I have witnessed and been part of <a href="http://www.empathyvulnerability.com/">Empathy and Vulnerability</a> - a workshop led by Jonathan and Michael Bean. I enjoy practicing meditation and I have worked one-on-one along with personal coach Jeridan Kowal. During Summer 2016 I attended the <a href="https://mindfulnessyvr.com/">MBSR program</a> with Dr. Erika Horowitz and learned the importance of practicing mindfulness in my daily life.</p>
			<p id="sub">Courses</p>
			<p id="paragraph">On Summer 2016, I attended a <a href="http://www.sfpirg.ca/events/workshop-design-facilitation-a-course-for-social-environmental-change-makers/">course on Workshop Design and Facilitation</a> led by Anna Soole and learned to design workshops that practice inclusiveness of gender identities and expressions, that support the deaf and LGBT communities and that acknowledge our ancestors and recognizes Vancouver as unceded Aboriginal territory.</p>
			<p id="sub">Workshops</p>
			<p id="paragraph">I facilitated my first workshop on Synaesthesia during the Winter Intention gathering that took place from December 30 2015 to January 3 2016. During this workshop, I guided participants through meditation and a series of activities to explore the senses of sight and touch, and to express their experience, thoughts and feelings in the form of a painting. </p>
			<br/>
			<p id="paragraph">On Summer 2016, I facilitated for the second time during the music festival Re:Unity. During this workshop I led a series of games and discussions around synaesthesia, embracing one's own quirks and expressing emotion through body painting. I was lucky to have found another synaesthete in this workshop and was touched by learning from his own experiences. At the end of the workshop, participants explained the meaning of their body painting.</p>

			<p id="syn">Resurgence and Re:Unity</p>
				<p id="paragraph">Intention is one of the only consensus-based participant driven and volunteer-run conscious local summer gatherings. I joined the Intention Community over a year ago and first stepped in as an organizer for <a href="http://resurgence.intentiongathering.org/info">Resurgence</a> in January 2016. My main focus in Resurgence this summer revolves around Workshop Coordination as well as recruiting and leading First Aid volunteers. </p>
				<p id="paragraph">Doing this work has given me the opportunity to connect to amazing workshop facilitators and also to learn more about putting different offerings in a way that is harmonious and in line with the core values that Intention stands for: consent-based, volunteer-driven and co-created.</p>

			<p id="syn">Sense Workshop Series</p>
			<p>I have been working along with Loretta Laurin, founder of <a href="https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/sense-workshops-vancouver-spring-session-tickets-22928471676">Sense</a>, and maintaing communication with all workshop facilitators regarding their needs as well as maximum capacities. I also keep the registration sheet up to date and update drop-ins on availability.</p>
			<p>Working on the administrative aspect of running Sense has given me insight into the importance of having excellent written communication skills and also the importance of problem-solving and reasoning that my Mathematics background has to offer. One example of this includes finding structured ways (i.e. spreadsheets, data analyzing, graphs) to otherwise messy ways of learning more about drop-ins and the way participants distribute. </p>
