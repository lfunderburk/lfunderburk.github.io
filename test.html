		<div class="section">
			<p id="sub"><strong>Student Researcher in Mathematics</strong></p>
			<p id="paragraph">Currently, I am a third year Mathematics Student at Simon Fraser University. </p>
			<p id="paragraph">I was born in Durango, Mexico where I lived for thirteen years before moving to Coventry, England. After one year I returned to my hometown but moved to Pachuca, Hidalgo shortly after where I did my highschool. Three years later I moved to Mexico City where I started my B.Sc. in Mathematical Engineering. It was two years later that I moved to the beautiful Vancouver in British Columbia and transferred to SFU where I am doing a B.Sc. in Mathematics.</p>
			<p id="paragraph">As a Mathematics student and work-in-progress researcher, I enjoy attending Mathematics Seminar and Conferences. Some of the seminars I have attended include the weekly <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/math/research_groups/discrete_mathematics/seminar.html">Discrete Math Seminar</a> as well as the PIMS Abelian Varieties Multisite Seminar.</p>
			<p id="paragraph">Engaging in discussion around Mathematical topics is an activity I also hold close to my heart and thanks to a number of researchers as well as graduate students within the Mathematics, Physics and Computing Science Departments I have had the opportunity to explore further what doing research is like.</p>
			<p id="paragraph">Exploring that which is outside my comfort zone along with my ability to persevere and move through adversity are key components of the work that I am attracted to and that have given me the ability to engage in Mathematical Research as an undergraduate student. I am not particularly gifted in my area of interest, but my love for the subject is what keeps me moving. </p>

			<p id="syn">Synaesthete</p>
			<p id="paragraph">I was born a synaesthete. <a href="http://www.youramazingbrain.org/brainchanges/synesthesia.htm">Synaesthesia</a> is a neurological condition in which two or more of the five senses are experienced involuntarily at once.</p>
			<p id="pragraph">In my case, I experience sight-touch, sound-touch, grapheme-colur, taste-sight, sound-sight and conceptual synaeshtesia. Most of the time this represents more challenges than advantages as a Mathematics student since there is no practical use to feeling sounds and colours, seing music or tasting mathematical operations.</p>
			<p id="paragraph">Having an appreciation for the arts and the senses has left me feeling like something is missing in my day-to-day life as a Mathematics student. I have decided to give myself the opportunity to explore settings where music, painting, writing and dancing are practiced with no judgement of what is right or wrong about expressing one's Self.</p>
			<p id="paragraph">One example is the <a href="https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/sense-workshops-vancouver-spring-session-tickets-22928471676">Sense Workshop Series</a>. Here I have been able to fuse my love for creative expression as well as my logical skills. For the past three months I have been the Drop-In Admin and so I ensure maximum capacities per workshop are not exceeded. I also analyze data from students once the workshop is completed.</p>
			<p id="paragraph">Another example of this is the work I have been doing as an organizer for the music festival taking place this Summer: <a href="http://resurgence.intentiongathering.org/info">Resurgence</a>. I am currently in charge of coordinating workshops as well as recruiting and leading volunteers for the First Aid Pod.</p>
