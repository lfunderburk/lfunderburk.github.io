		<p id="title">Student Researcher in Mathematics</p>
			<div class="section">
				<p id="listdes">Currently, I am pursuing a B.Sc. in Mathematics at Simon Fraser University. </p>
				<p id="listdes">As a Mathematics student and work-in-progress researcher, I enjoy attending Mathematics Seminar and Conferences. Some of the seminars I have attended include the weekly <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/math/research_groups/discrete_mathematics/seminar.html" target="_blank">Discrete Math Seminar</a> as well as the PIMS Abelian Varieties Multisite Seminar.</p>
				<p id="listdes">Engaging in discussion around Mathematical topics is an activity I also hold close to my heart and thanks to a number of researchers as well as graduate students within the Mathematics, Physics and Computing Science Departments I have had the opportunity to explore further what doing research is like.</p>
				<p id="listdes">Exploring that which is outside my comfort zone along with my ability to persevere and move through adversity are key components of the work that I am attracted to and that have given me the ability to engage in Mathematical Research as an undergraduate student. I am not particularly gifted in my area of interest, but my love for the subject is what keeps me moving. </p>
				<p id="listdes">My research interests include Algebraic Combinatorics, Graph Theory and Cryptography. Wheres I have only had an opportunity to get a taste for what is like to do research in the former two, my goal is to pursue Cryptography.</p>
