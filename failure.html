		<p class="section">I believe that work that is worth pursuing is filled with the experience of failing. While failing can be a visceral experience on its own, and while those who surround me might find me lethargic and lost while having this experience, I still believe in recognizing the intrinsic value that failure provides and that society so often undermine.</p>

			<li>When I was near the age of eighteen I had my first piano recital. I have a deep love for music and I have always dreamed of playing an instrument so that when the opportunity presented itself to show others a little piece I had been practicing I thought I was immune to the fear of being witnessed by the public. I could have not misplaced my assumptions any further from reality. By the time I sat down in front of the piano and placed my hands on the keyboards I had completely forgotten my tune. I played what I could although I can assure you that whatever escaped from my hands that day did not resemble the piece I meant to present. To this day I cannot remember that song.</li>
