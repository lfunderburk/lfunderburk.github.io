			<p id="paragraph">I believe work that is worth pursuing is filled with the experience of failing. While failing can be a visceral experience on its own, and while those who surround me might find me demoralized and lost while having this experience, I still believe in recognizing the intrinsic value that failure provides and that society so often undermines.</p>
			<p id="paragraph">In this section I have selected some of the failures that have given me profound lessons I recognize I have failed a lot more times than I display here.</p>

			<p id="sub">Piano Recital</p>
			<p id="paragraph">When I was near the age of eighteen I had my first piano recital. I have a deep love for music and I have always dreamed of playing an instrument. When the opportunity presented itself to show others a little piece I had been practicing I took it with an air of optimism. In my mind I was immune to the fear of being witnessed by the public. I could have not placed my assumptions any further from reality. By the time I sat down in front of the piano and placed my hands on the keyboards I had completely forgotten my tune. I played what I could although I can assure you that whatever escaped from my hands that day did not resemble the piece I meant to present. To this day I cannot remember that song although in occassions I still sit in front of the piano and let my hands play as they like.</p>

			<p id="sub">Thrackles</p>
			<p id="paragraph">If there is a dream I keep close to my heart it is the dream of pursuing research. I have been accused of being a masochist in the past and I must be, for Mathematics has brought me more pain than joy but I would not dare dreaming of letting it go. The first time I tried research I collaborated with Dr. Goddyn on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrackle#Thrackle_conjecture" target="_blank">"Thrackle conjecture"</a>. I was assigned this problem as an undergraduate and my job was to write or debug a program in C that computed thrackle embeddings for paths of given length.</p>
			<p id="paragraph">By the time this problem arrived to my hands I barely had any memory of my C/C++ course so I failed to deliver what my supervisor asked for during the first two months. Luckily (and I make emphasis on the word luckily), I found a few online resources and spent enough extra hours staring at the code to eventually write what he asked of me. By the time my research intership was over, I failed to debug the code so that it worked. I felt a bit useless for the next few months but also appreciated having stayed despite the frustration than not knowing where I was going brought.</p>
			<p id="paragraph">A few months later my supervisor showed me the debugged piece of code we had been working on along with results. My heart pounded with joy that day. In a way, my supervisor's succes aliviated my own failure for I felt like I had done something that turned out to be useful after all. </p>
