		<p id="title">Student Researcher in Mathematics</p>
			<div class="bigsection">
				<p id="listdes">Currently, I am pursuing a B.Sc. in Mathematics at Simon Fraser University. </p>
				<p id="listdes">As a Mathematics student and work-in-progress researcher, I enjoy attending Mathematics Seminar and Conferences. Some of the seminars I have attended include the weekly <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/math/research_groups/discrete_mathematics/seminar.html" target="_blank">Discrete Math Seminar</a> as well as the PIMS Abelian Varieties Multisite Seminar.</p>
				<p id="listdes">Engaging in discussion around Mathematical topics is an activity I also hold close to my heart and thanks to a number of researchers as well as graduate students within the Mathematics, Physics and Computing Science Departments I have had the opportunity to explore further what doing research is like.</p>
				<p id="listdes">Since May 2017 I have been collaborating along with the Department of Mathematics at SFU via developing Python and Shell scripts that ease the process of performing Multiple Sequence Alignments for families of Anopheles mosquitoes. Since October 2017 I have also been collaborating via collecting data from public universities across Canada with the purpose of understanding the nature of first year Mathematics courses.</p>
				<p id="listdes">Exploring that which is outside my comfort zone along with my ability to persevere and move through adversity are key components of the work that I am attracted to and that have given me the ability to engage in Mathematical Research as an undergraduate student. I am not particularly gifted in my area of interest, but my love for the subject is what keeps me moving. </p>
