		<p id="title">Student Researcher in Mathematics</p>
			<div class="bigsection">
				<p id="listdes">My research interests include but are not limited to Graph Theory, Game Theory and Bioinformatics.</p>
				<p id="listdes">While pursuing my undergraduate studies I took a year off school to engage in experiential learning. During this year I worked as a co op student as a Help Desk Assistant at the BC Cancer Research Centre, and later did a semester abroad through the Erasmus+ Programme in Munich, Germany. While abroad I collaborated remotely along with SFU faculty on a Bioinformatics research project. </p>
				<p id="listdes">Through these two experiences I discovered my passion for doing research at the intersection of human health and mathematics. My passion drove me to learn Python programming and shell scripting on my spare time. A year after my exchange I joined the <a href="http://ireceptor.irmacs.sfu.ca/" ><span>iReceptor </span></a> team as a DevOps engineer. iReceptor is part of an international project facilitating access to next generation sequence data from the adaptive immune receptor repertoire. Through iReceptor, researchers and scientists can develop and improve vaccine design, therapeutic antibodies and cancer therapies. </p>
				<p id="listdes">Currently I am in the final year of the B.Sc. in Mathematics program and look forward to contributing knowledge towards the intersection between human health, mathematics, programming as well as social justice. My hope is to inspire people who form part of minority groups to take leadership and professional roles in the sciences.</p>
